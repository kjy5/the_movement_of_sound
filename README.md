# The Movement of Sound

This project visualizes the physicality of audio by using a speaker's diaphragm to reflect a laser beam and create a projection.

The basic speaker in this project sometimes struggles to reproduce bass frequencies. Despite the inaudible bass, the diaphragm still moves. With lasers, we can visualize the bass as vibrations in the projection, revealing frequencies hidden in the audio reproduction.

This repository hosts the device firmware.
